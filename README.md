üîê **Authentication for Model Context Protocol** - Monorepo

This repository contains the Civic Auth MCP library and examples for adding secure authentication to MCP servers and clients.

## üì¶ Packages

- **[`library/`](./library/)** - The main `@civic/auth-mcp` package ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@civic/auth-mcp))
- **[`examples/`](./examples/)** - Example implementations and demos

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Install the library
pnpm add @civic/auth-mcp @modelcontextprotocol/sdk

# Run examples
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm --filter example-server start
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run linting
pnpm lint
```

## üîí Security Auditing

This project uses `audit-ci` for dependency vulnerability scanning in CI/CD. To manage security vulnerabilities:

- **Configuration**: Edit `audit-ci.jsonc` to add vulnerabilities to the allowlist
- **Run audit**: `pnpm run audit:ci` (fails on moderate+ vulnerabilities not in allowlist)
- **CI/CD**: Security audit runs automatically on all PRs and pushes to main

To allowlist a vulnerability, add its identifier to `audit-ci.jsonc`:
```jsonc
{
  "allowlist": [
    "GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx",  // GitHub Security Advisory
    "CVE-2024-xxxxx",       // CVE identifier
    "1234567"               // NPM advisory ID
  ]
}
```

## üìö Documentation

Full documentation and usage examples are available in the [`library/`](./library/) package.

## üö® Legacy OAuth Mode

For backward compatibility, the `auth()` middleware automatically includes legacy OAuth endpoints that allow MCP servers to act as OAuth servers. This mode is **enabled by default** but is deprecated.

The following endpoints are automatically exposed:
- `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` - OAuth server metadata
- `/authorize` - Authorization endpoint (proxies to Civic Auth)
- `/token` - Token endpoint (proxies to Civic Auth)
- `/register` - Registration endpoint (if supported)

To disable legacy mode:
```typescript
app.use(await auth({
  enableLegacyOAuth: false  // Disable legacy OAuth endpoints
}));
```
